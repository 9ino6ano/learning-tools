Popular for writting configuration files and is a widely used format for different DevOps tools and applications
This is a serialization language , meaning different applications written in different languages can still communicate effectively using a standard format of data transfer, most popular [XML using <>, JSON using {} and YAML having none]
Easy to understand (human readable and intuitive) , its straight-forward and clean [also YAML is a superset of JSON meaning any valid json file is also a valid in YAML file]
Data structures are defined through line seperations and spaces with indentation
Use online tools to verify and test the yaml code before (saving it into the config.file) => onlineyamltools.com/edit-yaml / install a yaml plugiin/extension on your IDE
